Due to a large number of functions and classes, I did split the java file into 4 files.\
Person.java has the Person class, which consist of name, date of birth, date of death and relationships, either parent, children or spouse.\
FamilyTree.java has the FamilyTree class, which will add the person, event and relationship to the tree map.\
Event.java has the Event class, which consists of year of the event, the content of the event and sort the event by the year od the event.\
A3.java has the A3 class, which consists of the main function, which also serves as the main executable file to the entire program.\
\
This program will print out a family tree, which consists of the person, and anyone with relationship with them.\
The order are:\
The root person\
&nbsp;The child\
&ensp;The child (or children) of the child\
The spouse of the root person\
